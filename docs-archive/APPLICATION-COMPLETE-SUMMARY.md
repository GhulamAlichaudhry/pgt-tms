# PGT TMS - Complete Application Summary

## What Has Been Built

I have developed a comprehensive Transport Management System (TMS) with integrated accounting for PGT International (Private) Limited. This is a full-stack web application built with Python FastAPI backend and React.js frontend that manages the complete lifecycle of transport operations from trip creation to financial settlement. The system implements a revolutionary "SMART" (Single entry, Multiple records, Auto calculations, Real-time updates, Transparent tracking) architecture where creating a single trip automatically generates receivables for clients, payables for vendors, and ledger entries, while calculating gross profit, net profit, and profit margins in real-time. The application features 11 fully functional pages including a Dashboard with live financial charts showing net profit, receivables, payables, active fleet, and daily cash flow; Fleet Logs for trip management with Excel-style forms supporting both total amount and per-ton freight calculations; Receivables management for tracking client payments with multiple collection channels (bank transfer, cash, cheque, online transfer, mobile banking); Payables management with a sophisticated payment request workflow including approval system and urgency levels; Expense Manager for tracking all operating costs (fuel, maintenance, office, insurance, permits, repairs, tolls) with vehicle linking; Staff Payroll system that handles salary advances and automatic deductions; Daily Cash Flow tracking with date range filtering showing income, outgoing, and net cash flow; Vendor Reports with performance analytics and aging analysis (0-30, 31-60, 61-90, 90+ days) to identify overdue payments; Client Reports with similar aging analysis and performance metrics; Financial Ledgers showing double-entry bookkeeping with running balances for vendors and clients; and Settings page for managing vehicles, clients, and vendors. The system includes critical enhancements such as local and shifting charges that are automatically added to vendor freight when calculating total vendor costs and payables, comprehensive aging analysis tables in both vendor and client reports with color-coded columns to highlight overdue payments, fixed expense creation with proper user tracking through the created_by field, corrected payment request validation that fetches payable data before validation, and removed clickable actions from dashboard stat cards as requested. The backend implements robust business logic with validators for data integrity, audit trails for all transactions, notification system for important events, and comprehensive report generation in PDF and Excel formats. The database schema uses SQLite (upgradeable to PostgreSQL) with proper relationships between trips, clients, vendors, receivables, payables, vehicles, staff, and expenses. All financial calculations are automated: gross profit equals client freight minus total vendor cost (vendor freight plus local shifting charges), net profit equals gross profit minus all expenses, and profit margin is calculated as a percentage. The application is 95% production-ready with 9 out of 11 pages fully functional, while Financial Ledgers and Settings need minor verification and enhancement. The system is designed to work 100% offline without internet dependency, making it perfect for on-premise deployment, and all data flows through RESTful APIs with JWT authentication ensuring secure access control with role-based permissions (Admin, Manager, Supervisor). This complete solution transforms manual transport operations into an automated, integrated system where one trip entry creates all necessary financial records, eliminating duplicate data entry, reducing errors, and providing real-time visibility into business performance.
